# FFTW Convolution 1D Example

This is a simple translation to Java of 
the one-dimensional convolution example using FFTW in C++ 
found at [https://github.com/mosco/fftw-convolution-example-1D](https://github.com/mosco/fftw-convolution-example-1D).

# Compilation notes

To build and run locally, you will need to install java, mvn, and fftw.  Once the necessary packages are installed, 
build with `make build` and run with `make run`.  

To use docker instead, run 
```
make build-docker
make run-docker
```
